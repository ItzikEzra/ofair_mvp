# OFAIR Database Models Implementation Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive SQLAlchemy database models have been created for the OFAIR platform based on the masterplan schema. The models are located at `/root/repos/ofair_mvp/libs/python-shared/database/models.py`.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Modern SQLAlchemy 2.0 Syntax
- Uses `Mapped` and `mapped_column` for type hints and modern syntax
- Proper UUID primary keys with automatic generation
- Timezone-aware timestamps with automatic updates

### 2. Complete Entity Coverage
All entities from the masterplan have been implemented:

#### Core Tables
- **users**: Master account table with roles (consumer/professional/admin)
- **professionals**: Professional profiles with verification and ratings
- **user_profiles**: Consumer details and preferences

#### Lead System
- **leads**: Abstract lead table for all lead types
- **consumer_leads**: Consumer-specific lead details (PII sensitive)
- **professional_leads**: Professional referral leads with commission settings

#### Referrals & Proposals
- **referrals**: Lead transfer and referral tracking
- **proposals**: Professional proposals for leads with media support

#### Payments & Wallets
- **lead_payments**: Payment records with commission splits
- **wallets**: Professional wallet balances
- **wallet_transactions**: Individual transaction records

#### Support Tables
- **notifications**: User notifications system
- **contact_access_logs**: PII access audit trail
- **phone_revelations**: Phone number revelation tracking
- **professional_ratings**: Ratings and reviews system
- **projects**: Project lifecycle management
- **admin_audit_log**: Admin action auditing

### 3. Proper Relationships
- Complete foreign key relationships between all related entities
- Bidirectional relationships with proper back references
- Cascade behaviors defined where appropriate

### 4. Business Rule Constraints
- Commission percentage validation (0-90%)
- Rating range validation (1-5 stars)
- Positive amount validations
- Balance integrity checks
- Unique constraint combinations

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Comprehensive indexing strategy:
  - Single column indexes for frequently queried fields
  - Composite indexes for common query patterns
  - Unique indexes for business constraints
- Optimized for geographic and category searches
- Efficient status-based queries

### 6. Security & Privacy (PII Handling)
- PII fields clearly marked with comments
- Audit trails for all sensitive data access
- Support for Row Level Security (RLS) implementation
- IP address and user agent tracking for access logs

### 7. PostgreSQL-Specific Features
- **JSONB** columns for flexible data storage (preferences, metadata)
- **ARRAY** columns for multi-value fields (specialties, attachments, media URLs)
- **UUID** primary keys for scalability
- **Numeric** precision for financial calculations

### 8. Enums and Status Management
Comprehensive enum definitions for:
- User roles and professional status
- Lead lifecycle states
- Payment and transaction statuses
- Notification types
- Access logging types

## Commission Model Support
The models fully support the OFAIR commission structure:
- **Consumer leads**: 10% platform commission
- **Professional referral leads**: 5% platform commission + configurable referrer share (0-90%)
- Automatic calculation and ledger entry support
- Hold period and dispute management capabilities

## Data Integrity Features
- Check constraints for business rule validation
- Unique constraints preventing duplicate relationships
- Foreign key constraints maintaining referential integrity
- Balance validation ensuring financial accuracy

## Usage Examples

### Import Models
```python
from libs.python_shared.database import (
    Base, User, Professional, Lead, ConsumerLead, 
    ProfessionalLead, Proposal, LeadPayment
)
```

### Create Tables
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine("postgresql://...")
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

## Migration Ready
The models are ready for Alembic migration generation and can be used immediately with:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create initial OFAIR schema"
```

## Files Created
1. `/root/repos/ofair_mvp/libs/python-shared/database/models.py` - Complete model definitions
2. `/root/repos/ofair_mvp/libs/python-shared/database/__init__.py` - Updated imports and exports

## Next Steps
1. Generate Alembic migrations from these models
2. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies in PostgreSQL
3. Implement service layer with proper access controls
4. Add database seed data for testing

The models provide a solid foundation for the OFAIR MVP and are designed to scale with future platform growth.
