## Executive Summary

OFAIR is a two-sided marketplace and referral economy connecting **professionals** and **consumers**. The platform's core differentiator is **Lead Transfer & Referral** — professionals can create leads, share or refer leads to other professionals, and monetize those referrals. OFAIR itself captures commission on every closed job and acts as the payment & settlement hub for the MVP.

This master plan is a single, developer-ready document that contains the product requirements (PRD), system design (SDD), data model, API surface, security & RLS guidance, and a fully prioritized and detailed implementation backlog. Hand this to your development team and they will have the acceptance criteria, data model, and implementation tasks required to deliver the MVP.

---

## Vision & Unique Selling Proposition

* **Vision:** Become the leading referral-first marketplace for local service businesses, where professionals both find paid work and create monetizable leads for peers — powered by a transparent lead lifecycle, built-in payments, and trust mechanisms.

* **USP (Core Differentiator):** OFAIR is built around **Lead Transfer & Referral** — lead creators, sharers, and performers all earn value from a single closed transaction. All platform features (search, proposals, chat, payments, reputation) revolve around the lead lifecycle.

---

## MVP Scope (what we'll deliver)

**Consumer Web (Web-only)**

* Create a request (consumer lead) via a web form.
* View received proposals for that request.
* Accept a proposal and pay through the platform.
* Rate the performing professional after job completion.
* Notifications via email/SMS/push (user-configurable).

**Professional Web (mobile-first, PWA)**

* Professional profile, onboarding, certification upload.
* View personalized Lead Board (auto-filters by location & category).
* Create professional leads (rich form) and publish them to the network.
* Refer / transfer leads to other professionals (Referral workflow).
* See proposals on posted leads, accept proposals, mark job closed.
* Receive referral commission when referred leads close.
* In-app chat (text-only) between owners and proposers; profile details remain masked until owner accepts a proposal.
* Wallet: internal balance & payout history.

**Platform & Admin**

* Centralized payment capture and split (platform fee + referral payouts).
* Admin dashboard: lead moderation, dispute management, financial reports, user management.
* Audit trails (contact access logs, phone revelations).
* Basic analytics (leads, proposals, conversions).

**Non-functional & Security**

* RLS for sensitive data (phone numbers, client addresses).
* Audit logging on all exposures of PII.
* TLS everywhere, secure file storage (S3).
* Configurable payment provider integration (default: sandbox Stripe) and SMS/WhatsApp/email providers.

---

## Business Rules & Commission Model

**Payment capture model (MVP):** OFAIR collects payment from the consumer and is responsible for splitting funds to the performing professional and any referrers. Legal & compliance to be finalized with counsel; system is built with an abstraction layer so PSP choice and settlement rules are configurable.

**Commissions & splits (fixed rules for MVP):**

* **Consumer-created leads (client → platform → professional):**

  * Platform commission: **10%** of `final_amount`.
  * Performing professional receives: `final_amount - platform_commission`.
  * No referrer in this case (unless a professional referred the consumer lead — future feature).

* **Professional-created / referred leads (professional uploads & refers to others):**

  * Platform commission: **5%** of `final_amount`.
  * Lead uploader sets `referrer_share_percentage` when creating the lead (0–90%).
  * Referrer fee amount = `final_amount * (referrer_share_percentage / 100)`.
  * Performing professional receives: `final_amount - platform_commission - referrer_fee`.
  * Validations:

    * `referrer_share_percentage` must be <= 90.
    * `final_amount` must be >= `minimum_job_amount` (configurable) to ensure the performer receives a viable amount.

**Wallet & payouts**

* Payments land in platform's gateway and are recorded into `lead_payments`.
* After PSP confirms `paid`, platform creates ledger transactions: credit professional `available_balance` with their net share, credit referrer(s) with their fee, credit platform `revenue`.
* **Hold / payout policy**: configurable hold period (default **7 days**) before funds become withdrawable to mitigate disputes; admin can release funds earlier manually.
* Withdrawals: manual bank transfer integration (future work) or CSV batches for accounting. (User hasn't finalized PSP; system supports pluggable payout adapters.)

**Subscription (optional)**

* Optional monthly subscription for professionals: **\~100 ILS / month** as a launch price.
* Subscription benefits include: reduced commission (configurable), priority notifications for new leads, and higher visibility on Lead Board.
* System supports multiple tiers in the future but starts with a single optional tier.

## Key Data Entities & Schema (canonical)

> Below is the canonical schema summary. Full migration-ready SQL is in the Implementation Appendix (separate deliverable if requested). Primary types omitted for brevity but are standard PostgreSQL types: `uuid`, `text`, `numeric(12,2)`, `timestamptz`, `jsonb`.

### Core tables (high-level)

**users** — master account table

* id (uuid PK)
* phone, email, name
* role (enum: consumer, professional, admin)
* created\_at, updated\_at

**professionals** — professional profile

* id (uuid PK)
* user\_id (FK -> users.id)
* profession, company\_name, specialties text\[], location, rating, review\_count
* is\_verified, status, created\_at, updated\_at

**user\_profiles** — consumer details

* id (uuid PK)
* user\_id (FK)
* address, preferences, created\_at

**leads** — abstract lead

* id (uuid PK)
* type (enum: consumer, professional\_referral)
* title, short\_description, category, location, status (active/pending/closed)
* created\_by\_user\_id (FK users.id), created\_by\_professional\_id (FK professionals.id, nullable)
* final\_amount (nullable — may be set after acceptance)
* created\_at, updated\_at

**consumer\_leads** — consumer-only lead details

* lead\_id (PK, FK -> leads.id)
* client\_name, client\_phone (sensitive), client\_address, full\_description

**professional\_leads** — leads created by pros (rich)

* lead\_id (PK, FK -> leads.id)
* client\_name, client\_phone (sensitive), estimated\_budget, attachments (S3 paths), preferred\_sched
* referrer\_share\_percentage (0-90)

**referrals** — tracking transfers / referrals

* id (uuid PK)
* lead\_id (FK -> leads.id)
* referrer\_professional\_id (FK -> professionals.id) — who created/transferred the lead
* receiver\_professional\_id (FK -> professionals.id) — who accepted or was offered the lead
* commission\_percentage (numeric) — mirrors referrer\_share\_percentage at time of transfer
* status (pending/accepted/rejected/completed)
* created\_at, accepted\_at, completed\_at

**proposals** — proposals for leads

* id (uuid PK)
* lead\_id (FK), professional\_id (FK)
* price (numeric), description, media\_urls text\[], scheduled\_date, status (pending/accepted/rejected)
* created\_at

**lead\_payments** — payments & splits

* id (uuid PK)
* lead\_id, proposal\_id
* payer\_user\_id (consumer)
* final\_amount, platform\_commission, referrer\_fee, professional\_net\_amount
* status (pending/paid/failed/refunded)
* psp\_provider, psp\_reference, created\_at

**wallets** & **transactions** — internal ledger

* wallets: id, professional\_id, available\_balance, pending\_balance
* wallet\_transactions: id, wallet\_id, amount, type (credit/debit/commission), reference\_id, created\_at

**notifications**, **contact\_access\_logs**, **phone\_revelations**, **professional\_ratings**, **projects**, **admin\_audit\_log** — standard support tables (see Appendix for fields).

---

## Security & Data Access (RLS / Privacy)

**Principles**

* Only reveal PII (client\_phone, client\_name, client\_address) to the lead owner (creator) and to accepted proposal winners after owner explicitly shares details.
* Record every access to PII in `contact_access_logs` and `phone_revelations` with IP and user-agent.
* Admins can see everything but every admin read creates an audit entry.
* Use RLS policies with `current_setting('app.current_user_id')` and `app.current_professional_id` populated by the API layer.

**Example policy for `leads` (conceptual):**

* Public read (public listing view): allow rows where `status = 'active'` but expose only non-sensitive fields via a `public_leads_view`.
* Owner access: `creator_professional_id = current_setting('app.current_professional_id')::uuid` OR admin.
* Proposal access: only the lead owner and admins can list proposals; professional can list only their own proposals.

**PII exposure flow:**

* Lead owner reviews proposals in private UI → chooses a winner → upon acceptance, server runs a controlled function that: (1) marks proposal as accepted, (2) records contact access event, and (3) returns sensitive client data to the accepted professional.

---

## API Surface (service-by-service) — concise

All endpoints require token auth. Token verifies user\_id & professional\_id context.

### Auth Service (FastAPI)

* `POST /auth/send-otp` — { phone | email }
* `POST /auth/verify-otp` — { phone | email, otp } → returns token
* `POST /auth/revoke` — revoke token

### Users / Professionals Service

* `GET /users/me`
* `PUT /users/me`
* `GET /professionals` — public list (no phone)
* `GET /professionals/{id}` — public profile (no phone)
* `POST /professionals/{id}/verify` — admin-only

### Leads Service

* `GET /leads/public` — paginated public list (filters: category, location radius, subscription filter)
* `POST /leads` — create lead (consumer or professional)
* `GET /leads/{id}` — lead detail (auth required for PII)
* `PUT /leads/{id}` — update lead (owner)
* `POST /leads/{id}/share` — create a referral offer to another professional (creates `referrals` row)
* `POST /leads/{id}/proposals` — create proposal

### Referrals Service

* `GET /referrals` — list referrals relevant to professional
* `POST /referrals/{id}/accept` — accept referral (receiver claims lead)
* `POST /referrals/{id}/reject` — reject referral

### Proposals Service

* `GET /leads/{id}/proposals` — owners & admins see all; professional sees their proposals
* `POST /proposals/{id}/accept` — acceptance by owner triggers payment initiation

### Payments Service

* `POST /payments/initiate` — { proposal\_id, payment\_method } → creates `lead_payments`, returns PSP session
* `POST /payments/webhook` — PSP -> confirm payment
* `GET /payments/{id}` — payment status
* `POST /wallets/{professional_id}/withdraw` — request withdrawal (admin approves)

### Notifications Service

* `GET /notifications`
* `POST /notifications/send` — internal usage for templated messages

### Admin / Backoffice

* `GET /admin/leads`, `GET /admin/users`, `GET /admin/reports`
* `POST /admin/payouts/manual`
* `POST /admin/resolve-dispute/{id}`

## Lead Lifecycle — functional flow (detailed)

1. **Lead Creation**

   * Consumer fills the public web form → `POST /leads` with `type=consumer` and `consumer_leads` details.
   * Or professional creates a professional lead → `type=professional_referral` with `professional_leads` details including `referrer_share_percentage`.

2. **Discovery & Notifications**

   * System indexes lead and pushes it to the Lead Boards for relevant professionals (geo & category match).
   * Professionals who are subscribers (paid) receive priority push notifications.
   * Non-subscribed professionals still see the lead on their boards and may submit proposals.

3. **Proposals**

   * Pros submit proposals with price, timeframe and optional media.
   * Owner (lead creator) can review proposals and open the proposer's public profile (public profile shows rating + past jobs but not PII).

4. **Acceptance**

   * The owner chooses a proposal and accepts it via `POST /proposals/{id}/accept`.
   * Acceptance triggers `payments/initiate` for the consumer to pay, and the owner explicitly agrees to share PII with the selected performer.

5. **Payment & Settlement**

   * Consumer pays through the PSP integrated with OFAIR (platform captures money).
   * On PSP success webhook, platform computes splits (platform commission, referrer fee) and records transactions; funds move to `pending_balance` for recipients.

6. **Job Completed & Rating**

   * Performer marks job as completed → owner confirms.
   * After confirmation, platform finalizes settlement (moves from pending to available after hold period) and sends an automated rating request.

7. **Referral Payout**

   * When lead type is `professional_referral` and the referrer is different from the performer, the referrer receives their configured fee once payment is confirmed and job completion confirmed.

8. **Dispute Flow**

   * If either party opens a dispute within the hold period, funds are held and the dispute goes to admin for resolution.

---

## UX / UI Notes (Lead Board & Key Screens)

**Lead Board (professionals)**

* Grid/list with prioritized leads (paid subscribers pinned at top).
* Filters: Category, Subcategory, Location radius, Budget range, Lead type.
* Each lead card shows title, short description, budget (if any), distance, time posted, number of proposals.
* Clicking opens private lead details screen (no PII unless owner/accepted).

**Create Lead (professional)**

* Multistep form: Basic → Client Info → Attachments → Commission terms → Publish.
* Required: category, location, estimated\_budget, preferred\_schedule, referrer\_share\_percentage.

**Lead Detail (owner)**

* List of proposals, candidate profiles (public info), proposal accept button (accept triggers payment flow).
* Masked client information until acceptance; acceptance action reveals sensitive client info to the accepted pro and logs access.

**Public Consumer Flow**

* Simple form for request creation, confirmation page, view proposals page, accept & pay.

**Professional Wallet**

* Shows pending balance, available balance, payout requests, transaction history.

**Admin Dashboard**

* Leads table with search & filters, financial reports, disputes queue, user management, payout control.

* Story 11.2: Load testing for lead board & notifications.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (sample)

* Creating a professional lead with `referrer_share_percentage=20` and final\_amount=1,000 results in: platform\_commission=50 (5%), referrer\_fee=200, performer\_net=750. Ledger entries created and visible in admin UI.
* When a non-owner attempts to access `consumer_leads.client_phone`, API returns 403 and an entry in `contact_access_logs` is NOT created (since access was denied). When owner accepts proposal and platform reveals phone to winner, an `access_log` entry is created.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** median API response < 200ms under baseline load (configurable scale).
* **Availability:** 99.9% uptime objective for paid features.
* **Security:** PII encrypted in transit; RLS enforces row-level access; all admin actions are auditable.
* **Scalability:** Design for easy horizontal scaling of stateless FastAPI services, and ability to split DB into per-service clusters in the future.

---

## Open Questions & Pending Decisions (items needing stakeholder input)

* Final Payment Provider (PSP) selection and PCI scope (Stripe, local PSP, or iCount).
* Official dispute resolution SLA and hold period policy (default 7 days configured; legal to confirm).
* Exact subscription pricing & discount policy for subscribers.
* Withdrawal mechanisms and payout partners (bank transfer vs third-party payout).

---

## Next Deliverables (I can produce immediately)

1. Full SQL migration files for the schema above (Alembic-style).
2. OpenAPI skeletons (YAML) for Auth, Leads, Proposals, Payments, Referrals.
3. ERD diagram (SVG/PNG) showing relations.
4. Detailed sprint plan (6–8 sprints) with story-points & timeline.
5. Starter FastAPI skeleton for Leads Service (Pydantic models + RLS-demo functions).

---

## Recommended First 8-week Roadmap (high level)

* **Weeks 0–1:** Foundation (infra, repo, DB, CI).
* **Weeks 2–3:** Auth, Users, Pro profile onboarding.
* **Weeks 4–5:** Leads core + referrals + proposals.
* **Weeks 6–7:** Payments (PSP sandbox) + wallet integration + notifications.
* **Week 8:** Admin dashboard + QA, E2E, staging release.

---

## Final notes

This master plan is intended to be prescriptive and actionable. It codifies the referral-first business logic (5% platform commission on pro-referral leads, 10% on consumer leads), the data model separating consumer & professional leads, the referral/referrer lifecycle and commission formulas, and the developer backlog required for an MVP.

If you want I will:

* produce the **migration SQL files** next, and
* generate **OpenAPI specs** for Auth + Leads + Proposals + Payments with example payloads.

Tell me which of the "Next Deliverables" you want me to generate first and I will produce it immediately.

## Story Point Summary & Team Velocity Guidance

* Total SP estimated: \~365 (sum of sprints above).
* If team velocity is \~60 SP/week (3 backend, 2 frontend full-time), plan 6+ weeks; adjust per team size.
* Recommend two-week sprint cadence if you prefer larger iterations — multiply SP accordingly.

```

**Notes on repo:**

* Shared libs reduce duplication: pydantic models, db utilities, auth clients.
* Use workspace tooling (pnpm/workspaces or poetry + task runner) to run multi-service dev.
* Each service owns its Dockerfile and has a simple `docker-compose.override.yml` for local dev.
