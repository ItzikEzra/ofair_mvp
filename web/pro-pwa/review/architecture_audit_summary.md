3. **Monitoring**: No centralized monitoring for production issues
4. **Compliance**: GDPR compliance gaps for European users
5. **Rollback Strategy**: No automated rollback mechanism

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Critical Security (Immediate - Week 1-2)

**Priority 1: Authentication Security**
```typescript
// Current (Insecure)
const token = generateToken();
await supabase.from('auth_tokens').insert({ token, professional_id });

// Recommended (Secure)
const token = generateToken();
const hashedToken = await bcrypt.hash(token, 10);
await supabase.from('auth_tokens').insert({ 
  token: hashedToken, 
  professional_id 
});
```

**Priority 2: Rate Limiting**
```typescript
// Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
const rateLimit = new RateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many authentication attempts'
});
```

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Week 3-4)

**Bundle Optimization:**
- Remove unused dependencies
- Implement proper code splitting
- Add compression and minification
- Optimize image assets

**Database Optimization:**
```sql
-- Add composite indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_proposals_professional_status 
ON proposals(professional_id, status);

CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_professional_request 
ON quotes(professional_id, request_id);
```

### Phase 3: Observability (Week 5-6)

**Monitoring Implementation:**
- Centralized logging with structured logs
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance metrics collection
- Health checks for all services

### Phase 4: Deployment & Recovery (Week 7-8)

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
